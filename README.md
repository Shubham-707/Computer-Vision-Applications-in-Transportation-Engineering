# Computer-Vision-Applications-in-Transportation-Engineering
In an age moving towards Autonomous vehicles, Computer Vision has become a very essential skill, especially with the high computational abilities of modern days computers which is enabling tasks as complex as object detection successful in a fraction of a second. In this project, we will be using the Python language and working with libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc. We will initially dive into the various deep learning techniques starting from logistic regression and move our way up to Convolutional Neural Networks. We will also understand the maths behind the working of CNNs and will see its direct applications in the domain of transportation engineering through 3 to 4 challenges. Finally, we would try to build some custom architectures using Keras for these applications.
